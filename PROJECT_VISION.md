# Project Vision: The Sentient Homelab

This document outlines the vision for a "master repo" that serves as the central nervous system for a personal computing ecosystem. The goal is to create a self-managing, self-documenting, and self-improving system that automates system administration, configuration management, and knowledge organization.

This is more than just a collection of scripts and configuration files; it is a blueprint for a **sentient homelab**. The system will be aware of its own state, capable of reasoning about its configuration, and able to execute tasks to maintain, heal, and enhance itself.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Configuration as Code (CaC):**
    *   **The Principle:** Every aspect of the system's configuration—from installed packages and system settings to application configs and themes—should be defined as code. This ensures reproducibility, versioning, and automated setup.
    *   **The Goal:** To be able to recreate the entire master server and its satellite systems from scratch by running a single command. This includes OS-level setup, software installation, and user-level customization.

2.  **Continuous System Awareness:**
    *   **The Principle:** The system must continuously monitor its own state. This goes beyond traditional metrics like CPU and memory usage. It includes tracking every command executed, every package installed, every configuration file changed, and every log message generated.
    *   **The Goal:** To build a comprehensive, real-time "digital twin" of the system's state. This data forms the foundation for all analysis, decision-making, and automation.

3.  **AI-Driven Orchestration:**
    *   **The Principle:** An AI orchestrator, the "master brain," will be the core intelligence of the system. It will ingest the vast streams of data from the monitoring stack and use them to understand the system's health, identify potential issues, and plan corrective actions.
    *   **The Goal:** The AI will not just react to problems but proactively manage the system. It will perform routine maintenance, optimize performance, suggest improvements, and delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents. Its thought processes and decisions will be transparent and logged for review.

4.  **Integrated Knowledge Base:**
    *   **The Principle:** All documentation, personal notes, web clippings, and code snippets should be treated as a unified, queryable knowledge base. This knowledge base is not just for human use but is also a critical resource for the AI orchestrator.
    *   **The Goal:** A searchable, AI-enhanced website and API that serves as the single source of truth for all information. The AI will be able to ingest new documents, automatically categorize them, and use this knowledge to inform its system management tasks.

5.  **Secure, Federated Architecture:**
    *   **The Principle:** The system will manage not just a single machine but a fleet of devices (desktops, laptops, servers) connected over a secure network.
    *   **The Goal:** To use Tailscale for secure connectivity and a central monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) to aggregate data from all nodes. The master orchestrator will have a unified view of the entire fleet, enabling centralized management and coordinated actions.

## The End State

The ultimate vision is a system that largely manages itself. It will:

*   **Automate Onboarding:** Automatically configure a new machine to the user's exact specifications.
*   **Self-Document:** Continuously update its own configuration documentation (e.g., lists of installed packages, Ansible playbooks) as changes occur.
*   **Proactively Maintain:** Identify and apply system updates, clean up temporary files, and optimize configurations without human intervention.
*   **Self-Heal:** Detect and diagnose issues (e.g., a failing service, a misconfiguration) and execute automated fixes.
*   **Provide Insight:** Offer a natural language interface to query the system's state, history, and knowledge base.

This project sits at the intersection of DevOps, AI, and personal knowledge management. It is an experiment in creating a truly intelligent and autonomous computing environment.
