# OSINT Platform Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancement plan for the OSINT Platform to include advanced AI capabilities, robust deployment options, feature discovery, vector databases, knowledge graphs, and agentic workflows.

## Core Enhancement Areas

### 1. Advanced AI Configuration & Model Management
- Interchangeable model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- LiteLLM proxy for model abstraction and monitoring
- Configurable model selection with YAML files
- Bring-your-own-API-key support
- Feature discovery for compatible services

### 2. Robust Deployment System
- Ansible installer with full feature set (roles, playbooks, hosts, group_vars)
- Multiple deployment targets (local, remote, Docker, Podman, bare metal)
- Container orchestration options (Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes)
- Environment management (env files, Ansible Vault)

### 3. Vector Database & Knowledge Management
- Document ingestion pipeline (text, audio, video)
- Vector storage with pgvector, Weaviate, or Qdrant
- Knowledge graph generation capabilities
- OpenSearch integration for search capabilities

### 4. Agentic AI Framework
- Multi-agent system with CrewAI integration
- Memory management (short-term, long-term)
- Communication via RabbitMQ messaging system
- Rules engine for agent behavior
- Web interface for agent configuration

### 5. Feature Discovery & Extensibility
- Automated service discovery and feature detection
- YAML-based configuration management
- Repository of pre-configured services and providers
- User-extensible system for new features
