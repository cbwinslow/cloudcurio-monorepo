- GPG (for secure credential storage)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Pip Installation
```bash
pip install cloudcurio
```

#### Option 2: Docker Installation
```bash
# Pull the latest Docker image
docker pull cbwinslow/cloudcurio-mcp:latest

# Run the MCP server
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here cbwinslow/cloudcurio-mcp:latest
```

#### Option 3: Source Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbwinslow/cloudcurio-monorepo.git
cd cloudcurio-monorepo

# Run the installation script
./scripts/installers/install.sh

# Or install from source
pip install -e .
```

#### Option 4: Docker Compose (Complete Platform)
```bash
# Start the complete CloudCurio platform
docker-compose up -d

# - Ollama: http://localhost:11434
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Development

```bash
# Setup development environment
make setup

# Install development dependencies
make install-dev

# Run tests
make test

# Build all packages
make build

# Build specific packages
make build-pip        # Python package

Feature tracking is enabled by default. To start tracking your own features:

```python
from feature_tracking.feature_tracker import track_feature, FeatureCategory

@track_feature("my_custom_feature", FeatureCategory.AGENT_PLATFORM)
def my_function(param):
    # Your function logic
    return result
```

# Start the tracking dashboard
python -m feature_tracking.dashboard
# Access at: http://localhost:8081
```

#### Use the CLI
```bash
# List top features by usage
python -m feature_tracking.cli list-features --limit 10

# Get statistics for a specific feature
python -m feature_tracking.cli feature-stats my_feature

# List recent feature calls
python -m feature_tracking.cli list-records --limit 20
```
