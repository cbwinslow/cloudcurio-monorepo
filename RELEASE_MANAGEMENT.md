# Release Management for CloudCurio

This document describes the release management process for the CloudCurio project, including versioning strategy, release cycle, and tagging conventions.

## Versioning Strategy

CloudCurio follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Release Cycle

### Major Releases (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, etc.)

Major releases include significant new features, breaking changes, and architectural improvements.

#### Criteria
- Breaking API changes
- Major feature additions
- Architectural improvements
- Significant performance enhancements
- Security improvements requiring breaking changes

#### Process
1. Planning phase with RFCs
2. Implementation in feature branches
3. Beta releases for testing
4. Release candidate testing
5. Final release

### Minor Releases (v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)

Minor releases add new features and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Criteria
- New features
- Backward-compatible improvements
- Performance optimizations
- New integrations
- API additions (non-breaking)

#### Process
1. Feature implementation
2. Testing and review
3. Release preparation

### Patch Releases (v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc.)

Patch releases fix bugs and security vulnerabilities while maintaining full compatibility.

#### Criteria

- Security patches
- Performance fixes
- Documentation corrections
- Minor enhancements

#### Process
1. Bug identification
2. Fix implementation
3. Testing and review
4. Quick release

## Pre-release Versions

Pre-releases are identified by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.

### Alpha Releases (v1.0.0-alpha.1)

Early testing releases that may be unstable.

#### Characteristics
- Incomplete features
- Known issues and bugs
- Limited testing
- Experimental functionality

### Beta Releases (v1.0.0-beta.1)

Feature-complete releases undergoing testing.

#### Characteristics
- All planned features implemented
- Actively tested
- Bug fixes only
- Nearly stable

### Release Candidates (v1.0.0-rc.1)

Near-final releases with only critical fixes.

#### Characteristics
- No new features
- Bug fixes only
- Thoroughly tested
- Production-ready quality

## Tagging Conventions

### Version Tags

All official releases are tagged with semantic version numbers:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### Pre-release Tags

Pre-release versions include additional identifiers:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3-alpha.1 -m "Alpha release 1.2.3-alpha.1"
git tag -a v1.2.3-beta.2 -m "Beta release 1.2.3-beta.2"
git tag -a v1.2.3-rc.1 -m "Release candidate 1.2.3-rc.1"
```

### Component Tags

For monorepo components, use component-specific tags:

```bash
git tag -a ai/v1.2.3 -m "AI tools version 1.2.3"
git tag -a mcp/v1.2.3 -m "MCP server version 1.2.3"
git tag -a sysmon/v1.2.3 -m "SysMon version 1.2.3"
```

### Build Tags

For specific builds or commits:

```bash
git tag -a build/latest -m "Latest build"
git tag -a build/nightly-20231015 -m "Nightly build 2023-10-15"
```
